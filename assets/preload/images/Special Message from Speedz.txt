HEY! Thank for playing VS DOOR STUCK!

Sorry it took 9 FUCKING MONTHS to come out but FNF moment lol

I hope you enjoyed, make sure to check out everyone on the team, they all did such an amazing job.

This mod has been my heart n soul for the past couple of months with all the delays n stuff insane that its ever coming out, doesnt feel real. An idea that came from me shitting now into what it is now? jesus christ.
The support has been insane 250k people already on GB page? WHAT THE FUCK? i love you guys. i hope we lived up to the 9 month wait.


We wanna do more in the future, we love the door stuck guy and we'd like to make him go to more places and maybe go up against some other base FNF characters cough cough Pico.

Anyways i better upload this mod because people are getting mad at me for typing this out, they have a gun and are forcing me the end this NOW, i could go on forever but thanks for playing, means alot to me and that team and uh
